# MARL-PC-Cleaning
Open source for the RL-assisted PC cleaning scheme proposed by [*2021 58th DAC*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9586084). We propose to mitigate the tail latency of PC cleaning of the DM-SMR drive by using reinforcement learning technology. The DAC paper has been extended to a journal paper submitted to [*IEEE Transactions on Computers*](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tc).


### Run:
1. Compile the whole project and generate the driver module.
2. Insert the driver module.
3. Create a simulated SMR disk.
4. Perform the block I/O workload and set up the *blktrace* tool.
5. Analyze the collected data using *blkparse & btt* tool and get the latency information.


### Notes: 
1. The linux kernel version is *4.10.0-42-generic (ubuntu 16.04)*.
2. We build our scheme based on the initial version published on [*FAST'15 - Skylight*](http://sssl.ccs.neu.edu/skylight)[1]. This is a very creative and enlightening work.
3. We use [*hfplayer*](https://github.com/umn-cris/hfplayer) as our block I/O replayer. This amazing work has been published on *FAST'17*[2] and you can find more details on their paper and Github website.
4. In order to get more accuate results, you have to shut down the write cache and the automatic power-saving mechanism of your disk with the help of *hdparm* tool.
